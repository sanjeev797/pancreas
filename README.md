Pancreatic cancer remains a challenging malignancy with one of the lowest survival rates among all cancers, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and rapid progression.This paper explores current advancements in the identification and analysis of urinary biomarkers for pancreatic cancer, offering new insights into their potential as diagnostic tools. 
The dataset we use comprises comprehensive information obtained from a cohort of 590 patients, categorized as follows:  Healthy controls (183 individuals) Patients diagnosed with non-cancerous pancreatic conditions, including chronic pancreatitis (208 individuals) and patients suffering from pancreatic cancer (199 individuals).
Using the machine learning models and classifiers like k nearest neighbour and catboost classifier we predict the possibilities of getting pancreatic cancer from the urinary biomarker samples.
